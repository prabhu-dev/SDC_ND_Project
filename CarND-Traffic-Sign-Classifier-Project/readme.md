# Project 2 of Term1 of SelfDriving Car Nanodegree.

* In this project, we get to the nitty gritty details of defining and training a ConvNet architecture to succesfully classify the German Traffic Sign Board dataset which consists of 43 different classes of traffic sign boards!

* You might require two datasets to get everything working in the ipython notebook.

* Original  Dataset : https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/November/581faac4_traffic-signs-data/traffic-signs-data.zip

* Augmented Dataset: This can be created from the iPython notebook itself. But, if you prefer to download it instead. Download from here.
